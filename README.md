# JUB facility booking
Due to the corona pandemic, Jacobs Universityâ€™s gym and pool has been shut down for a long time and now they finally decided to reopen the facilities. However, since the pandemic is still not finished, the facilities came up with a new regulation that it can have maximum of only 10 people at a time. Many people have gone to the facilities only to find out that they have to go back to their room to wait an extra 30 minutes just because the facilities are full. Thus, we came up with an idea of making an application/website that not only shows people how many people in the gym and pool currently, but also helps the staff to store the data of the members easily rather than writing everything on Excel.
